# OmiseGO Watcher

The Watcher is a observing node that connects to Ethereum and the child chain server's API.
It exposes the information it gathers via a REST interface (Phoenix)
For the responsibilities and design of the watcher see [Tesuji Plasma Blockchain Design document](FIXME link pending).

**TODO** write proper README after we distill how to run this.
